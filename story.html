                    We know that adjectives modify nouns. In the previous two classes we have seen that Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs.  Sometimes, we find it tricky to find out whether a word is used as an adjective or an adverb in a sentence.<br> <br> <span style="color: blueviolet;">  Today we will learn how to identify that. </span> <br>
  
                    ● In the past we had already studied comparative and superlative degree adjectives. Keeping that in mind, today we will also focus on the usage of Comparative and  Superlative degree adverbs. <br>

                    ● The use of intensifiers and mitigators with Comparative and Superlative adjectives and adverbs respectively.  <br>

                    ● We will also learn that Comparative and Superlative Adverbs can be formed by using the same rules as for Comparative and Superlative Adjective.
